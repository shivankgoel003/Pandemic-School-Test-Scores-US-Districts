# Assessing Factors Affecting Student's Performance during COVID 19 Pandemic

## Overview
This repository contains the replication code and data analysis for our research paper, which provides a comprehensive examination of the impact of various schooling modes during the COVID-19 pandemic on student test scores across different US school districts. Our study discusses the correlation between virtual, hybrid, and in-person learning models and their respective influences on academic performance. Through extensive data analysis, we highlight the ways in which the pandemic has shaped educational outcomes, revealing critical insights into the factors that have driven learning loss during this unprecedented time.

This work is a replication and extension of the research presented in "Pandemic Schooling Mode and Student Test Scores: Evidence from US School Districts," originally published by [The American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20210748). Our replication work can be found at SSRP with the DOI link [here](<https://doi.org/10.48152/ssrp-ydad-gj89>).

Note: Language Learning Model ChatGPT was also used while writing this research paper. It was used for purpose of code debugging, plotting graphs and knowledge of certain topics, which we were not aware of. The chat with the AI bot, is also attached as a reference under `inputs\llm`. 

Note: Our raw data from the original paper was extremely large, only relevant cleaned data of the raw data has been added to this repo for analysis. Link to replication package: https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/168843/version/V1/view

The repo is structured as:

-   `input/data` contains the data sources used in analysis including the raw data.
-   `outputs/data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `outputs/paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.
