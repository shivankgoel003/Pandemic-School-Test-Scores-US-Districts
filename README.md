# Assessing Factors Affecting Student's Performance during COVID 19 Pandemic

## Overview
This repository contains the replication code and data analysis for our research paper, which comprehensively examines the impact of various schooling modes during the COVID-19 pandemic on student test scores across different US school districts. Our study discusses the correlation between virtual, hybrid, and in-person learning models and their influence on academic performance. Through extensive data analysis, we highlight the ways in which the pandemic has shaped educational outcomes, revealing critical insights into the factors that have driven learning loss during this unprecedented time.

This work is a replication and extension of the research presented in "Pandemic Schooling Mode and Student Test Scores: Evidence from US School Districts," originally published by [The American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20210748). Our replication work can be found at SSRP with the DOI link [here](<https://doi.org/10.48152/ssrp-ydad-gj89>).

Note: Language Learning Model ChatGPT was also used while writing this research paper. It was used for the purpose of code debugging, plotting graphs, and knowledge of certain topics, which we were not aware of. The chat with the AI bot is also attached as a reference under `inputs\llm`. 

The replicated raw data could not be added to the `inputs\raw_data` as the files were too big to be added to Github. The data can be downloaded directly from the replication package.

Another dataset that was used from Household Pulse Survey has been added in `inputs\raw_data`. The website can be found at ([Household Pulse Survey](https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/hhp/#/?periodSelector=12&measures=JOBLOSS)).
